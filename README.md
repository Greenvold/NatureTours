#Nature Tours

This was a tutorial projects where I tried to apply CSS skills and only pure css with no additional framework.

It definately learned me how to apply advanced css selectors, flexobex and absolute positions as well as background videos and much more.

This project had the biggest impact on my CSS skills which I use on a daily basis now.

Whole projects is coming from a perfect Udemy course found here `https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/`
